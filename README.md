# Code Coverage with TomEE, JaCoCo and SonarQube

In this little example I present you how to easily run code coverage analysis for integration tests.

## How To Run

1. Compile the project with Maven first, as the class files need to be available for the Code Coverage Analysis:

   ```
   mvn clean package
   ```
   
1. Download the Jacoco Agent from [here](http://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=org/jacoco/jacoco/0.7.9/jacoco-0.7.9.zip).
1. Place it in the root of the repository (as it is linked in the docker-compose.yml)
1. Start the docker-compose stack.

   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
   
1. Connect to the maven container and change to /app:

    ```
    docker exec -it jacoco_maven_1 bash
    bash-4.3# cd /app
    ```
    
1. Fetch the JaCoCo Dump:

    ```
    mvn jacoco:dump -Djacoco.address=app
    ```
    
1. Run the SonarQube Analysis:

    ```
    mvn sonar:sonar -Dsonar.host.url=http://sonar:9000
    ```

1. Access the SonarQube Analysis under http://localhost:9000 and see the coverage report. It should say 0% of your code is covered.   

1. Access the sample application under http://localhost:8888/jacoco-example. Do some math calculations to see the analysis work.

1. Fetch the JaCoCo Dump again:

    ```
    mvn jacoco:dump -Djacoco.address=app
    ```
    
1. Run the SonarQube Analysis again:

    ```
    mvn sonar:sonar -Dsonar.host.url=http://sonar:9000
    ```
    
1. Access the SonarQube Analysis under http://localhost:9000 and see the coverage report. You should see 85.7% of Code Coverage.
